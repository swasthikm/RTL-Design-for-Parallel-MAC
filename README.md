# RTL-Design-for-Parallel-MAC
Developed a parametrized 8-bit RTL design for the Multiply-Accumulate (MAC), a fundamental digital block in machine learning accelerators. Design verification was conducted through a testbench in ModelSim, and the RTL design was synthesized to gate level using the freepdk45nm library
